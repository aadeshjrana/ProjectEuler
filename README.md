# Project Euler Solutions

## About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

## Structure

Each problem's solution is in its own file, named according to the problem number. For example, the solution to Problem 1 is in the file `1.py`.

## Languages Used

The solutions are primarily written in [Your Primary Language, e.g., Python]. Some problems may have solutions in multiple languages for comparison.

## Disclaimer

These are personal solutions and may not be the most efficient or elegant. The primary goal is to solve the problems and learn in the process. If you're working on Project Euler problems yourself, I encourage you to try solving them on your own before looking at these solutions.

## Running the Solutions

Most solutions can be run directly from the command line. For example:

```bash
python (Problem Number).py
```

## Contributing

While this is a personal project, I'm open to discussions about the problems and alternative solutions. Feel free to open an issue if you'd like to discuss a particular problem or solution.
